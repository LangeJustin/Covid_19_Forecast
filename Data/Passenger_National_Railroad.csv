"Note:Since 2008, statistical coverage of passenger traffic and freight traffic and passenger-kilometers and freight tons-kilometers of national railways and joint-venture railways have been adjusted, which national railways include those of state-holding joint-venture railways, and joint-venture railways only refer to non-state-holding joint-venture railways. In 2010 and 2011,statistical coverage of passenger traffic of joint-venture railways is different from before."
